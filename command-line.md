The command line is a way of talking directly to the computer.
Usually, when we talk to a computer, we use a mouse and we tell it what we want it to do based on visual information that it displays to us.
So usually, the computer shows us a button that says "do this"
And we click it, and the computer does it.

But with terminal, we don't have the machine prompting us with a button.
We have to say what we want, but in order to do this we have to know the machine's langauge. These are the terminal prompts and they are what we put into the terminal to get what we want.
